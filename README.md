# coding-events-demo

1. The purpose of the app is to connect users to events locally and virtually to build community in the tech industry.
2. The current state of the app is in demo and new features are in the design process.
3. The future improvement we are making in the ability for users to create a profile and get tickets to coding events. 
   This new feature will contain a username, password, location, and profile picture. Users will be able to get tickets, follow other profiles,
   and recieve notifications for events.
